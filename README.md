👋 Hi I'm Loni, and here you'll find repositories that focus primarily on DevOps with an emphasis on automation. From Python scripts to Go-based projects, this is where technology intersects with real-world problem-solving.

### Career Trajectory 🚀
I have over 8 years of experience in the cloud and open-source landscape, mostly as a Cloud Support Engineer. I specialize in automation within DevOps, contributing to enhanced system reliability and operational excellence.

### Flagship Project: Predicting Pandemics 🌍
I'm working on an open-source project aimed at predicting pandemic outcomes. Using basic infectious disease and hospital capacity stats, it projects pandemic scenarios over a 120-day period. This general model can be applied to any infectious disease.
